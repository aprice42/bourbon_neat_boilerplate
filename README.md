##About this Project
This project is intended to provide a blank slate for beginning any project with Bourbon and Neat. It was inspired by a Bourbon and Neat tutorial series by [phpacademy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWErI0VSxDCbeDyEJm_kVt3p). Wherein they outline a basic structure for organizing Sass project files that could be applied to nearly any web application. The method of organization loosely resembles the ideas presented by Jonathan Snook in [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), so I have drawn on some of those principles to establish clear guidelines for how to follow the given structure.

Hopefully this project can help save you some time with your next project!
